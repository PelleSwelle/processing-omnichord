This program is a remake of a physical musical instrument called and Omnichord.
There is a picture of one included in this folder, called "reference.jpg".

OBS: SOUND ON

The omnichord plays a chord when a button is pressed. 
The order of the chords layed out on the interface is based on the circle of fifths and includes both major and minor chords.
 
The program is controlled with the keyboard.
Top row of buttons is triggered by the top row on the keyboard Q - O
Bottom row is triggered by the second row on the keyboard A - L
This is also illustrated in the program itself.

When a key on the keyboard is pressed, the corresponding button will light up, indicating the button being pressed as well as the corresponding chord being played.

The colorscheme is taken from the reference photo to get a 70's vibe with a brown color for the body and muted white for the buttons.

The font BAMF ITALIC is from https://www.free-fonts.com and was chosen for it's 70's disco vibe.
